                            <p>My name is Jacob Shaver and I am a 15 year old "hybrid"
                            formed by music, programming, and writing. I have 
                            coded very little with python, javascript, HTML, and CSS
                            in the Computer Science course at DHS. During my free 
                            time, I go out and practice lacrosse with friends, 
                            teach myself the guitar, and play videogames with my
                            brother. I aspire to become an engineer, and I have
                            been accepted into my school's Engineering Academy.
                            I grew an intrest in coding after I witnessed one of
                            my friends programming on a new computer they got.
                            Mesmerized, I bought a book teaching me to code Python,
                            ad proceeded to go to a few Python coding camps a 
                            while later.</p>
                            <p>Personally, I do not have much experience in this
                            field. I am pretty familiar with Python 2.5 and 2.7,
                            and I have learned HTML and CSS and am learning javascript. I went through a 
                            few Python programming camps over the summer of 2017.
                            I have also completed programming Python 2.5 from 
                            Jason R. Briggs'
                            <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/python-for-kids-jason-r-briggs/1110914603#/">Python for Kids</a>
                            book a few years back.</p>
                            <p>Even though I do not have much experience in the 
                            programming field, I feel like I can still teach myself 
                            new programming languages and learn on my own alongside my class.
                            I am currently teaching myself guitar, and doing so alongside 5 years of lacrosse
                            has taught me to be persistant and persevere. You 
                            might have difficulty in the moment trying to teach 
                            yourself something new, but if you practice and keep
                            on trying, you will eventually learn it. I have also
                            learned from teaching myself guitar that you should 
                            not try to find shortcuts to success because they just 
                            slow you down and hurt you in the long run.</p>

                            questions, comments or concerns feel free to contact
