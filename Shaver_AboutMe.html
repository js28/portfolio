                            <p>My name is Jacob Shaver, and I am 14 year old "hybrid"
                            formed by music, programming, and writing. I have 
                            coded verymlittle with python, and I am practicing HTML and CSS
                            in a Computer Science course at DHS. During my free 
                            time, I go out and practice lacrosse with friends, 
                            teach myself the guitar, and play videogames with my
                            brother. I aspire to become a programmer, and I have
                            plans on making it into my school's Engineering Academy.
                            I grew an intrest in coding after I witnessed one of
                            my friends programming on a new computer they got.
                            Mesmerized, I bought a book teaching me to code Python,
                            ad proceeded to go to a few Python coding camps a 
                            while later.</p>
                            <p>Personally, I do not have much experience in this
                            field. I am pretty familiar with Python 2.5 and 2.7,
                            and I have learned HTML and CSS. I went through a 
                            few Python programming camps over the summer of 2017.
                            I have also completed programming Python 2.5 from 
                            Jason R. Briggs'
