                            <p>The objective of this project was to create a 
                            functioning app/game for the andriod interface. My 
                            partner and I decided to go with one of the advanced
                            games (from the choices given) to program, and after
                            that we went to work. We had to learn and use time 
                            management skills in order to code the game in the 
                            time slot alloted to coding the base game. Then, when
                            we had finished coding the game and getting feedback,
                            we decided to make some changes and add stuff. After
                            brainstorming, we decided to add more spikes/obstacles
                            to the game, slong with a background to add more 
                            color. Working on this project taught us two things; 
                            how to manage our time and how to set compromises. 
                            When working on this game, my parnter and I had 
                            different visions for what the game would look like,
                            but over time we compromised and wound up creating a
                            game we both are proud of. We also had to learn time
                            management. We had to find out how to allocate our 
                            time and learn how to break down our work into segments
                            that we could complete, yet still completing the work
                            to meet deadline. This project was overall really 
                            fun, and a link to our Project Notebook Documentaion is
